# .emacs.d

This is my personal emacs config, set up primarily for Python and
Javascript but also working with other languages gracefully thanks to 
```projectile```, ```company``` and other stuff. It uses ```use-package``` 
for package management and some useful keybindings.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository in your $HOME: ```git clone https://github.com/SanchezSobrino/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d```
2. Install virtualenv: ```sudo apt-get install virtualenv```
3. Install Python dependencies: ```sudo pip install jedi service_factory```
4. Install Javascript dependencies: ```sudo npm install -g tern```
5. Start emacs: ```emacs```
6. All the packages will be downloaded, installed, and configured automatically.
7. Enjoy :)
